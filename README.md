## Description
This project is something I made for fun. It's a website inspired by Peter McKinnon, who is an amazing photographer and filmmaker. A while ago, I designed how the website should look using a special program called Adobe XD. Now, after learning HTML and CSS for about a month and a half, I turned that design into a real website that you can visit online.
Creating this website was a big learning experience for me in web development, and I'm happy to share it with you. I hope you enjoy exploring this tribute to Peter McKinnon and his incredible artistry.
